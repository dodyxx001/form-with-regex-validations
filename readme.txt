Hello!

This file was created to implement knowledge of Regular Expressions in JavaScript.

The HTML, CSS and JS files were written by myself. The goal was to create a simple
page, which lets you input information into a form.
Javascript checks the inputs and filters them through regex patterns to determine
if they are valid or not.
For this purpose the validation function was written and forEach method was set to
check every element in the 'inputs' array.

When the entered value is 'valid', JavaScript assigns a class 'valid' to the given input.
If input is invalid, it recieves a class 'invalid'.

I added some CSS styling, which colors the boxes if the inputs are valid/invalid.
When the inputs are invalid, text is shown to let the user know what the requirements
for the inputs are.

Knowledge implemented in this project:

- creating HTML and basic webpage from scratch
- creating CSS file and styling elements with flexbox
- creating JS file and linking it with HTML
- basic regex filtering with e-mail filtering
- JS functions and loops
